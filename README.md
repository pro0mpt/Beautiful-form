# Beautiful-form

# Prompt: 

Create an interactive form page with the following features:

The page should be split into two halves:
The left half contains a Sign In form with fields for email and password.
The right half contains a Sign Up form with fields for name, email, and password.
Both forms should be styled with modern CSS and be fully functional.
Overlay a black-and-red gradient panel that dynamically shifts based on mouse position:
When the mouse hovers over the Sign In form, the gradient overlay should cover the Sign Up form.
When the mouse hovers over the Sign Up form, the overlay should shift to cover the Sign In form.
The transition of the overlay should be smooth, with animations that move the panel seamlessly between the two sections.
Ensure the forms are responsive, with proper layout and spacing for different screen sizes.
